# Abstract
This project aims to design and implement a remote-controlled lighting system with a buzzer circuit and a liquid crystal display (LCD), intended to help individuals who struggle to wake up in the morning. The system utilizes a remote control and an infrared receiver to manage the lighting and buzzer circuit, while an Arduino-based controller handles timing and display functions.

The system is designed to maintain the lights on until a specific time, after which the buzzer circuit will be triggered if the user has not pressed a button on the remote control. The LCD shows the current time, and a 4-digit 7-segment display counts down the remaining time until the buzzer circuit is activated. Once the buzzer is turned off using the remote control, the alarm can be reset via the remote.

This project has the potential to improve the quality of life for people who have difficulty waking up in the morning and can be applied to other aspects, such as time management and scheduling.
